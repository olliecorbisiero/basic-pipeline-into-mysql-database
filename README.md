# basic-pipeline-into-mysql-database
Rudimentary pipeline using Python to web scrape coding school information, clean and organise this into panda dataframes before inserting into MySQL database as tables where they can be queried for analytical purposes. 

Note: you need to create your own local MySQL database and update credentials in the last section of code to match. 

Note: advanced-sql-solutions.sql, basic-sql-queries-and-answers.sql, mysql-select-solution.sql are unrelated and intended to demonstrate MySQL proficiency.
